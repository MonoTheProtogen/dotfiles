# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, made by me, for me, if you want to use them feel free to but I seriously don't recommend using the shell script I made to auto-manage them, it's scuffed, it works for me, but I can't guarantee it won't mess something up for you

## Index
- `dotfiles` - script to back up files to the repo and install files from the repo (usage: `./dotfiles backup` backs files up, `./dotfiles install` installs files)
- `home` - contains files from the home directory, folder structure is kept
- `root` - contains files from the root directory, folder structure is not kept, and installation via `dotfiles` script is avoided on purpose

# DISCLAIMER
**The configs are highly messy and unorganized, possibly also really hard to read, I really only care about the fact it works, readability comes second, so if you plan on using these, sorry in advance.**
